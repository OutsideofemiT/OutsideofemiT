# 👋 Hi, I’m Carmen Wheeler (@outsideofemiT)

Emerging full-stack developer and brand strategist blending technical precision with poetic storytelling. I build scalable platforms for wellness and learning, experiment with ethical AI, and design modular systems that center intentional UX.

## 🔍 What I'm Working On
- **Smart Gym**: A full-stack wellness platform with membership management, QR check-in/out, café ordering UI, and Stripe integration.
- **Outside of emiT**: A cosmic archive of Afro-futurist digital art, genre-fluid aesthetics, and creative coding experiments.
- **Portfolio Refresh**: Currently evolving to reflect recent full-stack and AI-integrated work. Live at [carmenwheelerportfolio.vercel.app](https://carmenwheelerportfolio.vercel.app/)

## 🎯 Interests
AI-integrated interfaces · Scalable design systems · Music-inspired development · Ethical tech · Visual storytelling

## 🎮 Fun Fact
Wireframes used to feel like creative confinement—but I’m learning to treat them as quiet collaborators in the build.
